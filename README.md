This is my last project for the foundations part of TOP. Right now, I took a little break to relearn some of the concepts I've just learned and concepts from earlier parts of the curriculum. I'm also doing the FreeCodeCamp, and now plan on doing the projects in it's programs to add to my "portfolio." I plan on starting the calculator project in the next coming days so that I can finally start the javascript track on TOP and learn more in-depth concepts and skills. 

In this project, I will need to use everything I've learned from TOP as well as from outside resources to create a simple caluculator. From building a simple intereface using html and css, to using some functions with javascript, create a calculator that displays user input to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.
